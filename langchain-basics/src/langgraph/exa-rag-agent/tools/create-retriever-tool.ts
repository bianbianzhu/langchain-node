Governments will have to make important decisions on how to incentivize Research and Development (R&D). Yet, current assessments of climate neutrality typically do not include research-driven innovation. Here, we link two integrated assessment models to study R&D investment pathways consistent with climate stabilization and suggest a consistent financing scheme. We focus on five lowcarbon technologies and on energy efficiency measures. We find that timely R&D investment in these technologies lowers mitigation costs and induces positive employment effects. Achieving 2°C (1.5°C) requires a global 18% (64%) increase in cumulative low-carbon R&D investment relative to the reference scenario by mid-century. We show that carbon revenues are sufficient to both finance the additional R&D investment requirements and generate economic benefits by reducing distortionary taxation, such as payroll taxes, thus enhancing job creation.Achieving the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C implies peaking anthropogenic emissions as soon as possible through the phase-out of traditional fossil-based energy and the fast deployment of low-carbon and negative-emission technologies. These include renewable energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS) 1,2 . To achieve such a rapid transition, the pace of energy innovation and technology diffusion will have to be scaled up significantly 3,4 . Importantly, a large share of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions consistent with 2°C and below 2°C scenarios rely on technologies that are not fully market-ready today 5 .Public research, development and demonstration (R&D) investments play a critical role in fostering technological progress in all sectors, including energy 5,6 . Public investments provide \"patient capital\", and allow to overcome the uncertainty which is intrinsic in the process of non-incremental energy innovation 7-9 . The benefits associated with learning-by-research dynamics are particularly important for less mature technologies 10 . Indeed, state-funded investments for innovation, supported by coherent policy frameworks which include supply-side as well as demand-side policies, contributed to the development of cost-competitive low-carbon technologies, such as wind, solar LEDs and batteries for electric vehicles 7,11-13 . The literature supporting this thesis is rich, and results are largely consistent: R&D investments contribute to lowering energy technology costs 14 .Choices in public R&D funding among several low-carbon technologies at different stages of development-such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), batteries for electric vehicles and advanced biofuels-are instrumental to achieving the transition 15 . Informing such choices requires an understanding of the complex interactions between several low-carbon options, as tailored technology portfolios need to be identified depending on the geographical specificities and natural resource endowments of a given region and country16,17. Given the long time horizon which characterizes the energy system and\nclimate-related impacts, decisions on R&D investments need to be optimized intertemporally 18 . The timing of such investment is crucial to increase the likelihood of limiting global warming over the next decades 19 . Furthermore, a non-trivial question relates to the mechanism through which RD&D investments can be financed [20][21][22] .This latter aspect is overlooked in most integrated modeling assessments of climate stabilization.\nThis paper provides insights to inform the choice of energy technology portfolios, the timing of R&D investments, and a possible financing mechanism in the context of a rapid energy transition to limit global warming to well below 2°C. We soft-link two well-established Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs): WITCH 23 -to identify innovation investments for five key decarbonization technologies and on a package of measures promoting energy efficiency-and GEM-E3 24 to study a mechanism for low-carbon R&D investments through the recycling of carbon revenues. The use of a dynamic model (WITCH) allows calculating the optimal level of R&D investment taking into account the time lag with which lower technology costs accrue as a result of research investments 25 . Optimal R&D investments are those which are cost-effective for each region, i.e., the least-cost option maximizing each region's welfare, with or without a carbon budget constraint or an R&D budget constraint. Through WITCH, we account for the substitution and complementarity of different low-carbon technology options and allow for a full-century definition of the R&D investment pathways. The use of a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with a detailed representation of the economy (GEM-E3) allows us to study the R&D financing policy and understand the economy-wide competitiveness and employment implications of different investment choices. Specifically, GEM-E3 includes 67 production sectors-10 of which relate to the manufacturing of low-carbon technologies-and a representation of employment dynamics in the labor market.\nOur results provide insights on four fronts: global innovation strategies compliant with Paris targets, a feasible option for the financing of R&D through carbon revenues, macroeconomic repercussions of the R&D strategies, and the implications for the global mitigation cost of climate policies.\nResults\nOur analysis generates detailed results for different technologies and regions and for each of the scenarios explored. All regional results can be explored and compared using an open access on-line tool we developed (https://datashowb.shinyapps.io/web_shiny/). Here we summarize the main insights emerging from the analysis in terms of (a) global pathways, (b) the financing of additional R&D investments in stringent decarbonization scenarios and (c) regional macroeconomic effects. We also discuss (d) global climate policy costs with optimal R&D strategies. First, while optimal R&D investments in all scenarios fund a diverse portfolio of technologies, the relative importance of a given technology is different depending on the stringency of the carbon budget. In all three scenarios, the biggest share of investments is allocated to batteries for EDVs and energy efficiency. In the REF scenario and in the 2°C target, wind and solar represent respectively 0.0 0.5 the third and fourth largest R&D investments. In the 1.5°C target, advanced biofuels is the third most funded technology, before wind and solar, in line with historical shares 5 . For CCS and Wind, the results are more sensitive to the presence of a carbon budget than to the magnitude of the budget itself. The CCS share of R&D investments remains low compared to other technologies; this result is discussed more in detail below. Second, for more mature technologies, the overall optimal R&D low-carbon investments in stringent decarbonization scenarios do not necessarily mean more cumulative R&D investment for each technology, but rather earlier R&D funding (Fig. 1b). Indeed, total cumulative investments for solar and wind over the century in the REF and policy scenarios are similar, i.e., optimal investment does not require large scale-up in a policy scenario as compared to REF (see also Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11 of the Supplementary Information). Two considerations help explain this result. On the one hand, these technologies are characterized by high learning-by-researching and learning-by-doing rates. On the other hand, as we discuss below, in stringent decarbonization scenarios these technologies compete with CCS. Importantly, however, R&D investments for mature technologies in both climate policy scenarios are carried out earlier rather than later. In the case of solar, for instance, imposing a more stringent climate policy results in a displacement of solar R&D investments from the later years to 2030. Similar dynamics are apparent, to some extent, for wind. This result, emerging from a perfect foresight model (WITCH), confirms that R&D is a key component of the climate policy portfolio and that, for more mature technologies, it is not only its amount but also the timing of such investment that matters in achieving more stringent targets at lower costs. Note that the two-factor learning curve formulation included in WITCH contributes to achieving this result (see Equation 3 of Supplementary Information section 1). As mentioned above, the two-factor-learning curve formulation accounts for cost decreases arising from both R&D investments (through the knowledge stock) and from increasing deployment (through cumulative capacity). At the beginning of the century, optimal R&D investments are larger and result in lower installation costs, consequently leading to faster deployment. This increase in installed capacity, in turn, further lowers installation costs. The cumulative effect of these dynamics is more pronounced for technologies with\n\nProgrammes &amp; Events  If you’re a tech entrepreneur, be it aspiring, scaling or late stage, we have a programme for you. See here...\n\nBy Abrar Chaudhury and Jamil Wyne. This article is based on their   Climate Tech Opportunity   report.  \nWe are all feeling the heat. From Cerberus and Charon scorching Europe this summer, to the Horn of Africa’s drought stretching into a fourth year, to Typhoon Koinu flooding the streets of Hong Kong; extreme weather patterns are affecting every part of the globe. \nWith temperatures and anxiety rising, Climate Tech has emerged as a pivotal solution: to keep us within safe planetary boundaries and help humanity adapt to our changing world. Once considered a niche area of investment, it’s now in the mainstream. \nBut where is the money coming from, and where is it going? Do the sectors beloved by investors and entrepreneurs have the most environmental impact? And is the massive injection of capital helping innovation flow to the communities that need it most?\nIn one of the largest-ever global studies on Climate Tech, we’ve surveyed over 140 climate tech practitioners and interviewed over 60 investors, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and scientists from more than 20 countries. Their answers and insights illuminate ‘The Climate Tech Opportunity'.\nA climate gold rush \nStartup and investment activity in climate technology has skyrocketed. Broadly, we define 'Climate Tech' as referring to a range of innovations designed to mitigate, adapt or increase resilience to climate change.\nIn the years since 2015, when the Paris Agreement was signed, Climate Tech investment has increased nearly ten times, from $6.6 billion invested in climate tech companies to over $60 billion in 2022. Between 2021 and 2022 alone, there was an 89% increase in global climate tech funding. Everyone is chasing the next ‘unicorn’ - and we have already found at last 83 'climate unicorns'. \nBut our research shows that it will still take a lot more cash to keep the world on the path to 1.5 °C. According to The Climate Policy Institute, annual investment for overall climate finance, which was at $640 billion in 2020, will need to reach $4.35 trillion by 2030 and almost $6 trillion by 2040. \nAnd this current gold rush isn’t spread equally across the world. While climate change challenges are global, and climate entrepreneurs can be found in any country, climate tech funding is focused on a select few geographies. During the 2010-2022 period, outside of the US, China, EU, and India, the rest of the world accounted for only 8% of total climate venture capital (VC) activity.\nIn large part, this could be because the climate tech ecosystem – the collection of funds, organisations, regulations, markets and talent pools – needed to start and build climate tech companies, is still nascent in much of the rest of the world. However, this concentration of funding and attention is a factor behind one of the most unanimous verdicts in our work.\nThe opportunity gap\nLow-income communities and developing countries are already feeling the effects of climate change and are under-equipped to address them. Yet, 89% of our survey respondents do not believe that climate tech solutions are reaching the people who need them most. \nOur interviewees shared a broad consensus that climate tech is neglecting these vulnerable communities, but from there, opinions diverged.\nSome believe that ensuring that countries with"
